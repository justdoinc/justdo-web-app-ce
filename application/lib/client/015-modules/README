Modules
=======

Modules serves as a mean to organize our app code by functionality segments.

Modules should be viewed as an entity in the middle between Meteor Packages and application code. Allowing some degree of control over logic load order but still
highly integrated into the application.

Use this folder to initiate modules and to hold logic that you need available on
startup in any depth of the application client code tree.

**Augmenting modules with functionality in the application level is allowed.**
